# Work Day Scheduler

[Deployed Application](https://timweyel.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)

## Requirements

For this project, we were provided html and css starter code. I needed to implement the hourly view of the current day and allow for a task description to be saved, the background color to reflect whether the hour was in the past, present, or future and have the task description persist after a refresh.

### User Story

```

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Implementation

We were tasked with creating an application that did the following:
- The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- There are hourly blocks for standard business hours
- The hourly blocks are color-code to reflect whether it in the past, present, or future
- When you click on a timeblock, you can enter text
- The text entered can be saved
- The saved text persists after a refresh.
